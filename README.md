## How It Works

### Smooth Section Reveal
- Uses the `IntersectionObserver` API in JavaScript to add a `visible` class to sections when they enter the viewport, creating a fade-in effect.

### Chatbot Functionality
1. **User Interaction**: Users type messages in the input field and click the "Send" button.
2. **Message Display**: The user's message is appended to the chat window.
3. **Bot Response**: The chatbot echoes the userâ€™s input as a response (can be replaced with API-based responses in the future).

## Challenges in Development

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website adapts seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens.
2. **Chatbot Placement**: Positioning the chatbot unobtrusively while keeping it accessible.
3. **Smooth Animations**: Implementing fade-in animations using CSS and JavaScript for a modern and engaging user experience.
4. **Chatbot Functionality**: 
   - Handling user input validation.  
   - Designing logic for future API integration.
